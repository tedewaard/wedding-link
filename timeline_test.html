            <h3 class="mb-8">How we first met!</h3>
            <p class="">It was Christmas time and we both found ourselves at Bloomingdale's trying to puchase the same
                pair
                of black
                cashmere gloves. We
                basically fell in love instantly, but Kristen decided to leave our entire potential relationship up to
                fate.
                She
                wrote her name and number in a book and I wrote mine on a 5 dollar bill. Would fate prove we were meant
                to
                be
                together?...OK, OK
                this is the plot of Serendipity. We met on Hinge, best dating app ever baby!!!

                <p>Valentines 2020 was only a couple weeks after we were "officially" boyfriend and girlfriend. We took
                    a
                    little drive
                    to Rosy Mound Natural Area in Grand Haven and took a cold but pretty walk to the beach. This was
                    followed up with a visit
                    to The Toasted Pickle (definitely recommend if visiting Grand Haven).

                <h3 class="mb-8">Last night out before Covid</h3>
                <p>Honestly, the fact that Kristen and I found each out just a few months before Covid hit was so
                    fortunate,
                    but it also had
                    its own challenges. One example is the fact that we really couldn't do any more "out on the town"
                    dates
                    like going out to eat,
                    atending shows or going dancing. The first few months of a relationship is usually filled with these
                    experiences so we kind of
                    missed out on the "dating" feel. This picture is from St. Patties day, which was literally the
                    weekend
                    before everything shut down.

                <h3 class="mb-8">Boat Days!!</h3>
                <p>One of our favorite summer time activies is going out on the boat. Being out on Lake Michigan on a
                    beautiful summer
                    day is just unbeatable. I remember the first time we took the boat out because I was so excited to
                    share
                    one of my favorite things with Kristen.
                    We got to the boat launch and it was time to show off a little by executing a very impressive, near
                    perfect, backup of the trailer into the water.
                    The boat was in the water and all of our stuff was in the boat; we were ready to go! I turn the key
                    and
                    nothing happened. Turned
                    out to be some faulty wiring and we ended up spending that day back at my parents jumping in and out
                    of
                    our dog's kitty pool.

                <p>I believe this was one of the first weddings that Kristen and I attended together. It is SO much
                    better
                    having a date
                    to a wedding.
                    Andrew and Cait had a beatuiful wedding with a fun outdoor reception. It was a nice relief from the
                    doom
                    and gloom of Covid.

                <h3 class="mb-8">ROAD TRIP!!</h3>
                <p>Kristen's sister and brother in law live down in Murfreesboro Tennesse, which gave us the perfect
                    excuse
                    for our first
                    road trip. We visited Kelsey and Andrew, hung out in Nashville and ended the trip with a few days in
                    the
                    Great Smoky Mountains National Park.
                    That meant our first time camping and hiking together where we discovered that we are complete
                    opposites
                    when it comes to hiking. She
                    likes the long gentle incline hikes where as I like the steep hard hikes. We did both and saw some
                    amazing views.
